Personal Project - Marvel vs DC Universe
Problem Statement
The superhero entertainment industry, dominated by Marvel and DC, presents a rich landscape for analysis, yet the complexities and nuances of audience reception, critical evaluation, and financial performance are often overlooked. This dataset provides a comprehensive comparison of Marvel and DC movies and TV shows, capturing key attributes such as titles, release years, genres, runtimes, age ratings, directors, and leading actors. Additionally, it encompasses audience reception metrics through IMDb scores and the number of votes, as well as critical assessments via Metascore. Financial data, specifically USA gross earnings, offers insights into the commercial success of these franchises.

Despite the availability of this extensive data, questions remain regarding the factors that contribute to the differing receptions and successes of Marvel and DC productions. How do various attributes influence audience and critic perceptions? What trends can be identified in terms of genre popularity, director influence, or actor performance? How do financial earnings correlate with audience and critic scores?

By leveraging this dataset, analysts, fans, and researchers can delve deeper into the evolution of both universes, uncovering insights into their respective impacts on the entertainment industry and societal trends. This analysis aims to illuminate the underlying dynamics that shape the superhero genre, fostering a better understanding of its past, present, and future trajectories in a competitive market.
